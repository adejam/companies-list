The project demonstrates the use of Next-js and typescript in building a web application.

## Features

- View companies List
- Add a company
- Delete a company
- View single company

## Fetch data from external API

Due to using `localStorage` which would not work in `getStaticPaths` since `getStaticPaths` works on the server side, `useRouter` hook was used to get the `id` parameter which was then used to get the required data to show individual company.

In case an external API was integrated to the project, we can then use `getStaticPaths` to define a list of paths that have to be rendered to HTML at build time since the page uses a dynamic route. The code below would be used to achieve this.

```js
import server from '../../config';

export const getStaticPaths = async () => {
  const response = await fetch('API LINK TO FETCH ALL LIST OF COMPANIES');
  const data = await response.json();
  
  const paths = data.map((company) => ({
    params: { id: company.id.toString() },
  }));

  return {
    paths,
    fallback: false,
  };
};

export const getStaticProps = async (context) => {
  const { id } = context.params;
  const response = await fetch('API LINK TO FETCH SINGLE COMPANY DATA BASED ON ID PARAMETER');
  const data = await response.json();
  return {
    props: { company: data },
  };
};
```
